PROJECT TITLE: Gravity Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create a game in which meteors are shot into space where there are more massive objects.
The objective of the game is to "catch" an orbit and maintain it for as long as possible. The space's 
gravitational field is dependent on the massive objects in space and the meteor's path is dependent on the 
gravitational field and it's initial velocity.
